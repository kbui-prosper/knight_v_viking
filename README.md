# Knight v Viking

## Overview

Knight v Viking is a 2-player 2D real-time action platformer game. Each player controls a character (either a Knight or a Viking) using keyboard controls (Attack, Jump, ◀️, ▶️).

The Knight throws swords and the Viking throws axes. Swords are lighter and faster, but axes have more restitution and larger hit box.

Each character spawns with 100 health. Game is over when either player reaches 0 health.
