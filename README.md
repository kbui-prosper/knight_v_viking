# Knight v Viking

![Preview](https://github.com/khaivubui/knight_v_viking/blob/master/docs/Web%201920%20%E2%80%93%201.png)

## Overview

Knight v Viking is a 2-player 2D real-time action platformer game. Each player controls a character (either a Knight or a Viking) using keyboard controls (◀️, ▶️, Jump, Attack).

The character throws a weapon upward in 45° angle when the Attack key is pressed. Touching the enemy weapon will cause a character to lose 20 health. Weapon has 0.3 restitution (elasticity) and will disappear when velocity reaches 0.

Each character spawns with 100 health. Game is over when either player reaches 0 health.
